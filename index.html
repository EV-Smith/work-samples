          <h4>Web Design</h4>
            <p>Below are a few examples of websites and pages that demonstrate my proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="https://www.bellevuearts.org/" target="_blank">bellevuearts.org</a></strong>, which I maintain for Bellevue Arts Museum on the Umbraco CMS platform. The website was built by Garrigan Lyman Group in 2016 and I have served as the primary editor since its launch.
              </li>
              <li>A recent monthly newsletter from ___. All of BAM's email campaigns are hard-coded in Adobe Dreamweaver.
              </li>
              <li><strong><a href="http://ev-smith.github.io/portfolio/index.html" target="_blank">ev-smith.github.io/portfolio</a></strong> is an example of a website I built without the use of any frameworks for my certificate degree program at the UW in 2016. While it could use a content update, it is still a good example of my coding skills and demonstrates some of my work with JavaScript&mdash;notably in the video controls and the hover functionality of the photography landing page. There you will also find examples of my personal photography and a handful of videos not included on this page.
              </li>
              <li><strong>This webpage</strong> is an example of some quick work using Bootstrap framework.

            <h5><strong>TV Spot - Example 1</strong> | Playa Made: The Jewelry of Burning Man for KCTS 9</h5>
            <p>This spot features third party photography that I manipulated in Photoshop to create additional negative space&mdash;allowing me to fully fill the screen with imagery and avoid a split screen for the text. The spot was created in Adobe Premiere Pro and the vocals were provided by KCTS 9.</p>

            <p>While I haven't had the capacity to create long-form videos since the Museum's marketing team was reduced by one full time position a couple of years ago, I have had the pleasure of creating a number of feature videos for the Museum's annual auction, including this one from 2017.</p>
